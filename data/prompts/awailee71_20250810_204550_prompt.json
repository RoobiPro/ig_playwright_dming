Also, I am loosing energy because of a lot of work right now. I donâ€™t know how to finance my life. I am going to have to make some changes soon.. besides, I have 100 unread messages. ðŸ™ˆ Hope, youâ€™re doing fine! ðŸ˜˜"

It makes sense that youâ€™re feeling drained. Youâ€™ve been working so hard, and I hope youâ€™re giving yourself some grace too. If changes are on the horizon, just know Iâ€™m here for you through it. Youâ€™re incredibly talented, and I have no doubt that whatever you decide next will lead you somewhere even better. And hey, donâ€™t stress about the unread messages, the right ones will wait for you. ðŸ˜‰ Iâ€™m doing okay over here, just missing your light. Take a deep breath, take care of yourself, and remember youâ€™re not alone in this. ðŸ’•"
