Ideally I would be a housewife, but I also would enjoy working a part time job, something meaningful a couple days a week. Of course I want a family. I love traveling, eventho I haven't seen much, the little I was able to travel, I really enjoyed it, so war I only traveled inside my country. I mostly enjoy Indonesian food and I have a special love for spicy food. Now its your turn ðŸ˜ƒ"

I work and live now in Greece but before I worked and lived in Spain, Cape Verde, The Gambia, Bulgaria, Mexico, Ireland,â€¦ From degree Iâ€™m actually a care taker. I worked before with kids who had autism and are blind, I worked aswell in an asylum centre for refugees, I works with young adults with Down syndrome. I love traveling and my biggest dream in life is to have a family. Unfortunately I havenâ€™t been blessed with a family which is my biggest fear in life! I love Italian food but also Greek or Mexican food."

Greece, Spain, Cape Verde, Mexico - I'm honestly a bit jealous of all the places you've experienced ðŸ˜… Your care work sounds really meaningful too, especially working with kids with autism and in asylum centers. That takes a really good heart. It's cool that we both love travel and want families someday. The age difference is definitely there but seems like we're after similar things in life. What has been your favorite place to live in? ðŸ˜Š"

Love and friendship is so important, surround yourself with good people. Thank you, I didnâ€™t do it to get recognition but I did do it out of the good of my heart. Age is a number, the important thing how you feel for each other and how you feel when you are together, what you willing to do for each other. Favourite place? So difficult to say as I loved being in every place I went to. Going somewhere is not about the place but about the people you meet. My favourite place is where I feel loved"
