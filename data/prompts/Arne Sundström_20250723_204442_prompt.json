At 67, you seem so active and full of life! Age is just a number when the connection feels right. I'm actually really drawn to mature partners who have that kind of stability and wisdom. Right now I'm juggling university studies with my village social project here in Bali, lots of beach walks, sketching designs, and sneaking in spicy food challenges when I can! What's your favorite way to relax after a day working on your land projects?"

        "message": "Good evening from Sweden! What are you studying? I like to sit outside and look and listen to nature around me. The bumblebees go from flower to flower and hear the buzz from them. See the butterflies, see and listen to the birds. Or fishing a little if I can catch some fish for my daughters cat. Even I have started to feel sorry for the fish now. If we were together we will find what we will do for relaxation. Often in the autumn one can see elk here and can see the fox all the year around."
