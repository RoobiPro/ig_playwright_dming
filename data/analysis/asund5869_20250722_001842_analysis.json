At 67, you seem so active and full of life! Age is just a number when the connection feels right. I'm actually really drawn to mature partners who have that kind of stability and wisdom. Right now I'm juggling university studies with my village social project here in Bali, lots of beach walks, sketching designs, and sneaking in spicy food challenges when I can! What's your favorite way to relax after a day working on your land projects?",
