      "Hi Kaila, it is softening my soul when I look at you clips. I’m planning to hike, swim and relax in Bali and Lombok somewhere coming half year. How is it to live in Bali for you. Spiritual I feel deeply connected with the buddhist Thich Nhat Hanh a Vietnamese. I visited his temple in Hue last year. It is nice to be connected with a soul like yours🙏🏼 https://youtu.be/alej6887zMM?si=7rFuOj4DjBbTvnbS",

Just the thought of the nature, the energy, and the culture gives me a peaceful feeling already. And i want to learn Windfoil on the water. I looked it up a bit, and I saw that while Hinduism and Buddhism are different in many ways, there’s actually some overlap — like the focus on inner peace, meditation, karma, and compassion. That connection really fascinates me. I’d love to experience how spirituality is part of daily life in Bali. Do you have favorite places, rituals, or moments that make you feel spiritually grounded there? Do you know about my country Holland?"

I worked on a business plan for my new business that starts 1st October. This weekend i worked day and night to set up a professional website. With this i can start approaching people. I finished it Sunday. This morning I had a meeting with a company for a tool i need and Tomorrow for the location. Last Tuesday my education. It is going fast now. After this week it is calmer and focussing on buying couch and something to cover windows in the new house. Oh and a bed 😂 As I promised my daughter my old one. How are you feeling? Have a nice day dear Kaila💛"

I admire how focused and driven you are, also the fact that you still make time for your daughter and even give her your bed, that’s so sweet! 😍 And yes, I totally agree about cooking, it’s one of the most beautiful ways to express love and creativity. Your pizza sounds like a dream! I’d love to try it one day! And deal, I’ll make you my cheesecake in return 😄. I’ve been feeling stressed lately, taking things slowly and enjoying the little moments.

I hope you’re giving yourself enough space to breathe and recharge you truly deserve that. This weekend, I did just that: took time to cook something colorful curry with rice, pineapple chutney, and mint garlic yogurt. It was simple but grounding. Cooking really helps me stay present maybe it does that for you too? Oh and I visited the new location it looks so professional! Even better: a key government contact of mine will move into the same building. Great timing for my business and makes things more personal too. Do you want to share what’s on your mind?

Still a bit of a challenge with that headache 😅 Amsterdam with the team was full of good energy and it felt nice to reconnect. Practicing guitar with my daughter has been a joy.

It’s beautiful that Turkey gave you a peaceful goodbye, those moments shape us quietly. And practicing guitar with your daughter sounds like such a sweet rhythm to share. I can imagine the glow in her eyes when she gets something right 😊 Thank you for what you said about the violin ❤️ I haven’t played much lately… being a student and trying to build something creative on my own has made life full in other ways. Most of my energy now flows into writing, visual storytelling, and just… showing up vulnerably online, even when it’s messy.😜 I recently started a little Patreon, it’s where I share the more honest, quieter parts of myself. 🥰 A space outside the daily noise. Would that be something you’d feel called to support? No pressure, of course, just felt safe to ask you that since I feel like I am slowly getting closer to you. That's why I feel confident to share it with you because I also deeply enjoy sharing stories with you😊. Wishing you and your daughter a beautiful, music-filled day, Kaila ☀️",

Your Patreon sounds like a beautiful space, and I respect the way you’re showing up vulnerably. At the same time, I also find myself wondering how you see this connection between us. In the past, when I felt this kind of warmth with someone, it sometimes grew into something more real beyond messages. We would talk more directly, share voice notes or even video calls, and get to know more about each other’s daily lives, families, or just small, real things. I’m open to deepening our connection, if that’s something that resonates with you too. Just wanted to be honest about that. Warm thoughts from here 🍀 Ivo"
