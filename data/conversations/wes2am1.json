    "message": "I would say that since I have traveled extensively through the Philippines and Taiwan. I find you can only real and quality people in the rural areas. Both Taiwan and the Philippines are very populated. In Nicaragua it is more like the rural Philippines but much population ( Philippines= 179 million people versus Nicaragua with under 65 million people ) Less corruption than the Philippines and much safer, much quieter and the people here are poorer than Filipinos'. But Nicaraguan people value friendship and hard work more than the the people of the Philippines. Taiwan is the most educated but are less friendly to Westerners. The climate of Nicaragua is very similar to Thailand, Vietnam and the southern Philippines. Also similar to Indonesia. ( Much cooler in the mountains) Very tropical with sugar cane & coffee as major crops. Plus 22 active Volcanos."
