It would be really great if you could help me get started there, a local’s help is worth its weight in gold, you locals really know what to see there, places that you can’t find as a tourist.

I’m really passionate about sharing the beauty of Bali through my own lens, both as a local and as a content creator. I actually started a little Patreon where I share more personal insights, behind-the-scenes moments, and local life you wouldn’t always see as a tourist 🌿 It also helps me keep creating the content I share here on IG, from my sketches to cultural moments to quiet thoughts. If you’re curious to get a deeper sense of my world, I’d love to have you there 🧡"

      "That’s such a beautiful thing to say, Ramnarine… thank you ❤️ You always put so much heart into your words, it means a lot to me. I’ve been pouring my own heart into creating lately too! 🥰 moments, visuals, reflections that I sometimes don’t post here. That’s why I started a little Patreon, a more personal space where I can share the real side of my creative world. It helps me stay independent, keep building my social media presence and continue showing up with depth, not just surface. If you’d like to be part of that space or support what I’m building, I’d truly love to have you there since I feel you've already become a part of my little world❤️😘 Here’s the link: patreon.com/Kailas_World",
