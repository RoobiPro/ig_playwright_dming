I look forward to meeting a woman that's ready to go on an adventure that will present the most amazing things this life can offer."

    "message": "I'm curious to hear about your village project. I've helped to develop a few village projects throughout my 7 years here in Bali. Some friends and I recently organized a clean up project in Tampaksiring. And I helped out with the rice exchange initiative during COVID, which was really special. I'm curious to know what made you choose accounting as your focus? Do you like numbers? We've been looking for a great bookkeeper and accountant at my company recently, and as you can imagine, it's hard to find someone passionate and committed to support with our bookkeeping and accounting. I have so many favorite beaches. This past weekend I went to Virgin Beach and I also spent the weekend on a quiet little beach near Amed. And what are you most passionate about in life? As a writer myself, I just wanted to say that I think that you're a great writer. Wishing you a beautiful rest. Sweet dreams!"

Of course you're naturally beautiful, but the way that you craft your videos and weave story to invite people to experience life through you is truly remarkable. As an added bonus, it seems that you were also leveraging advanced technology to enhance your videos to become even more beautiful. Very impressive and I would like to compel you to consider that this might be the place to be focusing your energy as it will create tremendous value for you and all that you love, and I believe that your training in accounting will help you to build a content engine that will generate incredible returns and profitability. So I just wanted to share these words to inspire you to focus even more on following your excitement. And in doing so, you will inspire so many people, yourself included!"

Coming from someone like you who‚Äôs spent years guiding creative projects, that really means a lot. üôè Creating content is such a fulfilling but also emotionally demanding path üòÖ, especially when you're building something meaningful without a big team behind you. I‚Äôve been pouring so much of myself into my little world lately, and to help sustain it, I recently launched a Patreon. It‚Äôs where I share the more raw, personal, and sometimes even messy side of the journey, the parts that don‚Äôt always fit into the curated square of Instagram.
