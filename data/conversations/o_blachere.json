How can you describe yourself if you don’t mind?"

About love across borders, I believe real connections can happen anywhere, though my village project keeps me pretty grounded in Bali for now! I would say I am a regular girl, trying to navigate this sometimes crazy plane of existence hehe. How you described yourself?"

The life has made myself be what I am today : a young Happy guy growing in a beautiful island getting older & wiser, and growing, encountering many people, traveling/visiting many countries … though: a honest man, nice, responsible, with heartfelt heart, his own character… 🙃wanting to enjoy a new life, greeting moments with a nice wife… What is the way to meet someone in life like you ? To interest you? Would you like to know many friends before having one day only the one man to get to know to live with?"

    "message": "Yes, you’re right, Love is for me a question of feeling it could be at first sight as there are conditions make you feel like you’re in front the one as regard her beauty, there’s also the attraction between two persons, but in another hand you get more more interested by someone that you’re getting to know, seeing her, with whom talking to, so it’s in general the time spent with someone that is important too, it takes time though I would tell 🙂Kaila is a beautiful name, you look young and smart I wish I could spend time with you in real one day So tell me about you about the conception of love, if you’re are romantic? What kind of relationship would you like to have?"
