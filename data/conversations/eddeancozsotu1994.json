    "message": "Hi Virelle team ðŸŒ¸ Thank you so much for reaching out! I appreciate your kind words and love the aesthetic of your brand. Iâ€™d be happy to explore a possible collaboration! Before we move forward, Iâ€™d love to clarify a few details to make sure weâ€™re aligned: 1. Will the jewelry piece be fully gifted, or is there any cost or shipping fee involved on my side? 2. What kind of content are you expecting in return (photo, video, number of posts, etc.)? 3. Are there specific captions, tags, or hashtags youâ€™d like me to include? 4. Will I be able to choose the piece myself, or will you select one for me? 5. How do you plan to use the content (e.g., only on your Instagram, or in ads/marketing as well)? 6. Do you have a brand brief or short agreement outlining the collaboration? Looking forward to hearing more and thank you again for thinking of me âœ¨ Best wishes, Kaila"
