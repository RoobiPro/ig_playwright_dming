    "message": "A young filmmaker from India asked me if I can write a script for an Indian horror short film for him. But he has no money and the story should be based on German mythology! I like people from Asia, so I agreed to write the script for free. The characters or rather, I took the characters from European fairy tales. So from the fairy tales \"Little Red Riding Hood\" and \"Hansel and Gretel\". The story takes place today. The filmmaker from India did not have enough money for production, so he didn't use my script. This is that short film script that takes part in several film festivals. The title is \"red in the wood\". I am still working on an action and a fantasy series."
