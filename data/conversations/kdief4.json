That’s why I sent you this message , like a bottle in the sea just wondering what would happen after. BTW I’m from France. I live in Metz a city in the east of France. I am a surgeon and I am single searching someone for a long term relationship"

Being a surgeon sounds like a big responsibility. I can imagine life must be busy but fulfilling. What kind of surgeon are you? Wishing you lots of success, both in life and in finding someone who shares your dreams and values 💫 Take care for now and lots of positive energy to France, Kaila"

      "In the rush of chasing dreams and deadlines, we forget the simplest truths. Your health is your true wealth, your peace is your power, and believing in yourself is a full-time job. It’s not always grand gestures we crave, but a warm laugh, a safe presence, and someone who truly gets us. A stable home, a kind soul, and a heart that chooses peace over chaos is what truly matters. So travel freely, feel deeply, and shine unapologetically. Don’t waste your energy worrying. Use it to bloom, to love, to rise. Because everything, eventually, will work out. Just keep going."

I might just have to take you up on that one day 😄 There’s something so grounding about living with the rhythm of the seasons. Here in Bali, it's more tropical abundance than slow ripening… but I miss that sense of time passing through fruit and soil. You know, I’ve been pouring a lot of my energy lately into creating. writing, capturing moments, building something of my own. I started a little Patreon where I share the more personal, quiet parts of that journey, the kind of things that don’t always make it to Instagram. Maybe you’d enjoy seeing that side of me too, it's art btw. not what you think! 🤪 and if it’s something you’d like to support, I’d be really grateful 🌸 But for now… I’ll imagine us clinking glasses over freshly pressed grape juice in September 🍇✨"
