In the USA, we typically have elementary school from kindergarten through sixth grade, middle school from 7th through 9th grade, high school from 10th through 12th. Then there are various different schools from trade schools to universities, both public and private. One can graduate with an AA degree, typically a two-year program, or a BA or BS degree, an undergraduate degree from a four-year university. Then there are post graduate schools such as Medical Schools, Law Schools, Schools of Architecture, Psychology, and other areas of study. Many of those programs are within various universities.
