Let the rain cleanse, let it renew, Washing the old, making way for the new. In every drop, a quiet refrain— Beauty blooms, even in the rain."

One shade the more, one ray the less, Had half impaired the nameless grace Which waves in every raven tress, Or softly lightens o'er her face; Where thoughts serenely sweet express, How pure, how dear their dwelling-place. And on that cheek, and o'er that brow, So soft, so calm, yet eloquent, The smiles that win, the tints that glow, But tell of days in goodness spent, A mind at peace with all below, A heart whose love is innocent!"

I’ve been pouring my own heart into creating lately too! 🥰 moments, visuals, reflections that I sometimes don’t post here. That’s why I started a little Patreon, a more personal space where I can share the real side of my creative world. It helps me stay independent, keep building my social media presence and continue showing up with depth, not just surface. If you’d like to be part of that space or support what I’m building, I’d truly love to have you there since I feel you've already become a part of my little world❤️😘 Here’s the link: patreon.com/Kailas_World",
